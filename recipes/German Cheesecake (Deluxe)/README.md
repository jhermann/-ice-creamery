# German Cheesecake (Deluxe)

Inspired by German cheesecake, which is made with ‚ÄòQuark‚Äô or ‚ÄòTopfen‚Äô
‚Äì think of a cross between yogurt, cottage cheese and ricotta.
The lemon juice and soured milk add tanginess.

Spin on Lite Ice Cream.

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.
 1. Weigh and mix dry ingredients, easiest by adding to a jar with a secure lid and shaking vigorously.
 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.
 1. Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
