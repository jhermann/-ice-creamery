# Mandarin Sherbet (Deluxe)

Mostly mandarin slices and juice, which means a relatively high sugar content,
but still reasonably lo-cal because it has only 1% fat.

Small ice crystals (but then it is a sorbet / sherbet),
and still immediately scoopable after 1 day in the freezer.

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.
 1. Weigh and mix dry ingredients, easiest by adding to a jar with a secure lid and shaking vigorously.
 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.
 1. Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
