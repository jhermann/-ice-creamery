# PB Mix

PB&J ice cream, based on PB powder and dried strawberry slices.
This one is a favorite, so it gets its own recipe mix for convenient indulgence…

To make your life easier, take the “prep” ingredients times 8, mix them, and store in an air-tight 1l container.
Then use ~125g of that mix in your final base (or 85g for a regular 16oz tub).
