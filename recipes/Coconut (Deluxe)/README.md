# Coconut (Deluxe)

Processed on Lite Ice Cream, comes out as soft-serve, with a minor hint of ice crystals.
Given the high fat content, this is NOT low-cal, and would probably also work on Ice Cream,
for a denser consistency directly after processing.

Coconut is unsurprisingly the dominant flavor.

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Add "wet" ingredients to empty Creami tub.
 1. Weigh and mix dry ingredients, easiest by adding to a jar with a secure lid and shaking vigorously.
 1. Pour into the tub and *QUICKLY* use an immersion blender on full speed to homogenize everything.
 1. Let blender run until thickeners are properly hydrated, up to 1-2 min. Or blend again after waiting that time.
 1. Add remaining ingredients (to the MAX line) and stir with a spoon.
 1. Put on the lid, freeze for 24h, then spin as usual. Flatten any humps before that.
 1. Process with RE-SPIN mode when not creamy enough after the first spin.
