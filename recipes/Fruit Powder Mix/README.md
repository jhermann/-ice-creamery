# Fruit Powder Mix (Deluxe)

This one is a favorite, so it gets its own recipe mix for convenient indulgence…

To make your life easier, take the “prep” ingredients times 8, mix them, and store in an air-tight 1l container.
Then use ~125g of that mix in your final base (or 85g for a regular 16oz tub).

It works for fruit or root powders with a sugar content from low (Ube, 10%) to high (Lingonberry, 73%).
Counting the pre-made mix as one, it is a 5 ingredients recipe, including the water.
