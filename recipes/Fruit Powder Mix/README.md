# Fruit Powder Mix (Deluxe)

This one is a favorite, so it gets its own recipe mix for convenient indulgence…
It works for fruit or root powders with a sugar content from low (Ube, 10%) to high (Lingonberry, 73%).

Counting the pre-made mix as one, it is a 5 ingredients recipe, including the water.
Use ~125g of the mix in your final base (or 85g for a regular 16oz tub).

To make your life easier, take the “prep” ingredients times 4, mix them,
and store in an air-tight 1l or 1.3l container (1l is the minimum you need for 500g powder).
To mix, take a BIG bowl like used for baking, measure the ingredients,
and whisk them carefully but thoroughly. A ball whisk works best.
